# Pawsome — Game Brief

## What we are making

**Pawsome** is a solo-player, 2D maze adventure. Guide a dog through a small maze, find a treat to win over the princess dog guarding the way, solve a simple obstacle, and reach the exit before time runs out.

The aim is one finished, enjoyable level that we can build and play within the available time. The challenge comes from the maze and its small set of interactions, not from making many levels.

## Shared direction

- **Players:** One person plays alone from start to finish.
- **Hero:** The player controls the dog.
- **Story:** The dog wants to get through the princess dog's kingdom. The princess dog blocks a passage and wants a treat.
- **Goal:** Find the treat, get past the guard, and reach the maze exit before the timer expires.
- **Format:** A compact 2D maze with clear movement and readable obstacles.
- **Scope:** Build one complete level first. Add polish or optional features only after the core game works.

## Player experience

1. The start screen introduces Pawsome and gives the player a clear **Play** button.
2. At the start of the maze, a brief prompt shows how to move.
3. The player explores, finds the treat, and learns the route through the maze.
4. The princess dog blocks a corridor. Giving her the treat lets the player pass.
5. One simple lever or movable object may open a blocked route or crossing.
6. The player reaches the exit to win. If time runs out, show a retry option.
7. A short ending screen celebrates the dogs reaching the end of the maze.

## Build priorities

### Priority 1 — Playable core

- One small maze and one controllable dog.
- Wall collision and an obvious exit.
- A treat the player can collect.
- A guarding princess dog that blocks the route until offered the treat.
- A timer and clear win, timeout, and retry states.

### Priority 2 — One meaningful maze interaction

- Add **one** lever or movable block that changes the route.
- Teach the interaction when the player first reaches it with a short prompt.
- Keep the solution visible enough that players can understand what changed.

### Priority 3 — Game feel and presentation

- Add the available dog, maze, and treat art.
- Add a small set of sound effects or music if time allows.
- Add optional balls as collectibles for bonus points only if they fit without delaying the playable core.
- Tune the timer after a quick playtest; 90 seconds is a starting value, not a locked decision.

## Keep out of the first version

- Multiple levels or a 1–20 story-unlock progression.
- Multiple puzzle mechanics, complicated physics, or rotatable 3D paths.
- A penalty for backtracking or a one-life-only challenge.
- Optional collectibles before the win-and-retry loop works.
- Long dialogue, cutscenes, or elaborate animation.

## First 10 seconds

Show the movement control, let the player move immediately, and make the treat or next destination easy to spot. Introduce the lever prompt only when the player reaches the lever.

## Team workflow

1. Agree on the smallest maze layout: start, treat, guarding dog, optional lever, and exit.
2. Build movement, collision, and the complete win/retry loop before adding polish.
3. Play the level once without explanation; note where the player gets stuck or misses the goal.
4. Fix the biggest confusion, then add sound, art, or optional balls if time remains.
5. Keep the game runnable after each change so the team can review the same playable version.

## Decisions still open

- Final timer length, to be set after a playtest.
- Whether the lever/block puzzle and ball collectibles fit the remaining time; both are optional.
- Final art, sound, and implementation choices based on the team's available assets and tools.
